## Bugs
- Mobile swiping lag depending on which elements move. Fix or find alternate visual cue for swipe transition
- Laggy initial render
- POTENTIAL BUG: Past tournament accordions still render when collapsed. Could lead to bug with bunch of tournaments

## To-Do
- Add transition when hovering over nav for tab to extend visually upwards
- Add deck profiles (Youtube link below past tournaments, embedded in caption)
- Consider referencing old trailers?
